## Introduction to How the Web Works

The World Wide Web is a system of interconnected documents and resources accessible via the Internet. Users access these resources using web browsers, which send HTTP requests to web servers. Web servers process these requests and deliver the requested content back to the user's browser.

## Nginx: A Powerful Web Server

[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) is a high-performance, open-source web server known for its efficiency and scalability. It's commonly used as a reverse proxy server, load balancer, and HTTP cache. Nginx efficiently handles concurrent connections and can serve static content quickly.

## Configuring Nginx

Nginx's configuration is defined in the `nginx.conf` file. This file specifies server blocks, each containing server settings and directives. To configure Nginx:

1. Locate the `nginx.conf` file (typically found in `/etc/nginx/`).
2. Edit the configuration using a text editor.
3. Define server blocks for different websites or applications.
4. Set up virtual hosts, SSL certificates, and other server-specific settings.

Remember to test the configuration and reload Nginx using `nginx -t` and `nginx -s reload` respectively.

## Understanding Child Processes

Nginx employs a master-worker model. The master process manages worker processes responsible for handling client requests. If one worker becomes unresponsive, others continue to function without interruption.

## Root and Subdomains

Nginx can serve multiple websites from a single server using root and subdomains. The `server_name` directive specifies the domain(s) a server block should respond to. Root domains like `example.com` and subdomains like `sub.example.com` can be directed to different server blocks.

## Handling HTTP Requests

HTTP requests are messages sent by clients (usually web browsers) to request resources from servers. They include methods like GET, POST, and headers with information about the request. Nginx processes these requests and delivers appropriate responses.

## HTTP Redirection

Redirection involves sending clients to a different URL than the one initially requested. This is useful for moving content, handling outdated URLs, or enforcing HTTPS. Nginx uses the `return` or `rewrite` directives to manage redirection.

## "Not Found" HTTP Response Code

The "404 Not Found" response code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server. This could be due to a mistyped URL or a deleted file. Nginx's default configuration handles 404 errors by displaying an error page, but you can customize this behavior.

## Managing Log Files on Linux

Nginx logs various information to log files, helping with troubleshooting and monitoring. The main log files are usually located in `/var/log/nginx/`. Common log files include `access.log` (HTTP requests), `error.log` (server errors), and `error.log.{number}` (rotated logs).
