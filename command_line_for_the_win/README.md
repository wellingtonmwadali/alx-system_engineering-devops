# CMD Challenge

## Description
The CMD Challenge is a fun and interactive command-line-based programming challenge where participants are tasked with solving various programming problems using the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) or Command Prompt (CMD.exe). The challenge aims to test and enhance participants' knowledge of CMD commands and their problem-solving skills in a command-line environment.

## How It Works
The CMD Challenge presents participants with a series of programming problems, and their goal is to solve each problem by writing CMD commands or a series of CMD commands that achieve the desired outcome. The problems can range from simple tasks to more complex scenarios, requiring participants to think creatively and use CMD commands effectively.

Participants are provided with a problem statement that describes the desired behavior or outcome, along with any necessary input or constraints. They must then use their knowledge of CMD commands to write a solution that meets the requirements of the problem.

Once participants have developed their solution, they can test it directly in the CMD or CMD.exe environment to verify its correctness. The challenge encourages experimentation and iteration, allowing participants to refine their solutions until they achieve the desired results.

## Getting Started
To participate in the CMD Challenge, you'll need access to a Windows operating system with the Command Prompt (CMD) or Command Prompt (CMD.exe) application. These applications are usually available by default on Windows systems.

To begin, follow these steps:
1. Open the Command Prompt application on your Windows system.
2. Familiarize yourself with basic CMD commands such as `cd`, `dir`, `mkdir`, `copy`, `del`, `echo`, etc. These commands will be the building blocks for solving the challenge problems.
3. Read the problem statement provided for each challenge carefully. Understand the requirements, constraints, and expected output.
4. Write CMD commands or a series of CMD commands that solve the problem based on your understanding of the requirements.
5. Test your solution directly in the CMD environment to verify its correctness.
6. Iterate and refine your solution until you achieve the desired results.
7. Repeat the process for each challenge problem.

## Tips for Success
- Familiarize yourself with common CMD commands and their usage. Understanding the available commands will help you solve the problems more efficiently.
- Break down the problem into smaller tasks and think about how you can accomplish each task using CMD commands.
- Experiment and test your commands incrementally. Don't hesitate to try different approaches until you find the one that works.
- Make use of CMD features such as loops, conditionals, variables, and redirection to enhance your solutions.
- Read the documentation or online resources about CMD commands to discover more advanced techniques and possibilities.
