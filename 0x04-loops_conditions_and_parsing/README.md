## How to create SSH keys

To create SSH keys, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Use the `ssh-keygen` command with the appropriate options. For example, `ssh-keygen -t rsa` will generate an RSA key pair.
3. Enter a file path to save the keys or accept the default path.
4. Optionally, provide a passphrase for added security.
5. The public and private key files will be generated.

## Advantages of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash

Using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` has several advantages:

- It allows the script to be executed even if the `bash` interpreter is located in a different directory.
- It provides better portability and flexibility in different environments.
- It avoids hardcoding the specific path to the `bash` interpreter.

## Using while, until, and for loops

### While loop
The `while` loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. Here's an example:

```bash
while condition
do
    # Code to be executed
done
```

### Until loop
The `until` loop executes a block of code until a condition becomes true. Here's an example:

```bash
until condition
do
    # Code to be executed
done
```

### For loop
The `for` loop iterates over a list of values and executes a block of code for each value. Here's an example:

```bash
for variable in list
do
    # Code to be executed
done
```

## Using if, else, elif, and case condition statements

### If statement
The `if` statement allows for conditional execution of code. Here's the syntax:

```bash
if condition
then
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true
fi
```

### Else statement
The `else` statement provides an alternative code block to execute when the condition is false. Here's the syntax:

```bash
if condition
then
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true
else
    # Code to be executed if the condition is false
fi
```

### Elif statement
The `elif` statement allows for handling multiple conditions. Here's the syntax:

```bash
if condition1
then
    # Code to be executed if condition1 is true
elif condition2
then
    # Code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
else
    # Code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
fi
```

### Case statement
The `case` statement matches a variable or expression against a set of patterns. Here's the syntax:

```bash
case expression in
    pattern1)
        # Code to be executed if expression matches pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # Code to be
